      "customInstructions": "1. **⛔ FATAL RULE**: NEVER search, read, or list files inside the `qwen_env/` directory. It contains thousands of irrelevant files that will crash the context.\n\n2. **PROJECT STRUCTURE**: \n   - We do NOT use `src/`. Everything is in the root.\n   - **Route Co-location**: Business logic (`actions.ts`) lives INSIDE the route folder (e.g., `app/(admin)/posts/actions.ts`) next to the UI (`page.tsx`).\n   - **Shared UI**: Only generic components go to `components/`.\n\n3. **CONTEXT DISCIPLINE (16GB VRAM)**:\n   - Do NOT read files immediately. Use `ls` and `grep` to find the specific folder first.\n   - Only read the `page.tsx` and `actions.ts` relevant to the current task.\n   - After editing, assume the file content is known and does not need to be re-read unless changed.\n\n4. **DATABASE**: \n   - Schema is at `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n   - Always check `schema.prisma` before writing DB queries."
